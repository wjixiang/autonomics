//! Internal events for decoupled communication between subsystems and the
//! main TUI loop. Modeled after codex's `AppEvent` + `AppEventSender` pattern.
//!
//! Components that don't have direct access to the `App` struct (e.g. future
//! file search, plugin watchers, background tasks) can push events through
//! an `AppEventSender` which the main loop drains each tick.

/// Events that can be processed by the main TUI loop.

/// Currently unused — this is scaffolding for decoupled subsystem→main-loop
/// communication (file search, plugin watchers, background tasks) modelled
/// after codex's `AppEvent` pattern. Kept so the channel plumbing in `App`
/// stays type-checked as it gets wired up.
