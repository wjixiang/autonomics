//! Data-driven skill definitions.

//! A [`Skill`] is a declarative, ordered workflow built on top of tool
//! primitives. Each [`SkillStep`] declares the tools that are available
//! during that phase and the todos that must be completed before the
//! workflow advances to the next step.
//!
//! Both structs are `serde`-serializable so skills can be authored in code
//! or loaded from config files (TOML/JSON).
